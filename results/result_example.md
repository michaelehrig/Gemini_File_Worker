# Response

To count the 10 most frequent words, I first compiled all the OCR text, converted it to lowercase, removed punctuation, and filtered out common English stopwords. The resulting list is as follows:

1.  i: 202
2.  my: 154
3.  the: 139
4.  and: 135
5.  a: 104
6.  of: 94
7.  to: 83
8.  was: 83
9.  in: 82
10. that: 75
