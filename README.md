# Gemini File Worker

A quick learning project to understand how to upload files to the gemini client and construct responses with it.

In this case a file of a supported type (currently '.txt', '.md', '.pdf', and '.jpg') can be uploaded from the 'source/' directory. When a prompt is provided what to do with the file, the client is instructed to do as asked by the prompt and provide his response as a markdown file.
The response is then saves as a markdon file in the results/ directory.
